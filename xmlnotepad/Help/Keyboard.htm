    <h2>
        Keyboard Interface</h2>
    <p>
        The keyboard interface has been designed for convenient data entry. The usual sequence
        when building up an XML fragment is to use INSERT to enter a new node of the same
        type as the current node, type in its name then hit TAB to enter its value, then
        repeat this process and soon you will have quickly built up a document from scratch.

                    TAB navigates from the tree view to the corresponding node value then to the next
                    node in the tree view and so on. SHIFT-TAB does the reverse.</td>

                    Incremental search - as you type a sequence of letters, this search mode will match
                    the next node that starts with that sequence. The more letters you type the more
                    precise the match becomes. In a large document this is a convenient way to navigate
                    around.</td>

                    Normally drag/drop is a move operation. If you hold down the Control key then it

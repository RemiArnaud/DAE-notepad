	<h2>Intellisense</h2>
	<p>
	If an XML schema is provided for <a href="Validation.htm">validation</a> then this same
	schema is also used to provide intellisense.  For example, if your schema defines an
	<span class="delim">&lt;</span><span class="element">xsd:choice</span><span class="delim">&gt;</span>
	between the elements "fruit", "vegetable" and "berry", then when you insert a new node at this
	location you will be prompted with those choices as shown below:
	</p>
	<img src="images/Intellisense.jpg" />
	<p>
	Similarly, if your schema defines a simpleType with a list of 
	<span class="delim">&lt;</span><span class="element">xsd:enumeration</span><span class="delim">&gt;</span>
	facets, then this list of valid values is prompted when you edit the node value as follows:	
	</p>
	<img src="images/Intellisense2.jpg" align="left"/>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
	Then as you type the item matching the letters you have typed so far will be automatically selected 
	in the drop down list and when you type ENTER the selected item is copied to your edit field and 
	the intellisense selection is finished which saves you from having to type the whole string in manually.  
	This can result in much more efficient editing of XML documents.
	</p>
	<p>
	XML Notepad also supports special <a href="customeditors.htm">custom editors</a> for well known
	data types like date, time and color.
